            <p>Alex Munoz is National Geographic’s current Pristine Director for Latin America. He has been the driving force behind the creation and preservation of the seven largest fully-protected marine reserves in Latin America. To date, his work has protected 1.2 million square kilometers of ocean. He has also led many important ocean policy changes in Chile, including making it the first country in the world to legally protect all of its seamounts from destructive fishing, stopping coal-fired power plants from destroying marine habitats and fishers’ livelihoods, and establishing the first regulations to reduce antibiotic use and salmon escapes in Chilean salmon aquaculture.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Munoz will be speaking on catalyzing change through environmental protection while helping to advance human rights.
